# [SSIR](https://github.com/MaxWasTakenYT/SSIRewritten)'s GUI: The [*](*)FULL[*]() timelineðŸ˜Ž

## Name change(s)
Back when the project had to be done in Python, it had a different name, not even SSI (you can probably find it in the first commits of the readme.md)

### Idea [#1](): "C# and WinForms"
So, the idea was simple, since i just finished the mockup CLI version, i _just_ had to learn a bit WinForms to connect the C# logic i just had finished to the GUI.
<br></br>
It didn't go very far because, turns out that i'm not good (at all) at doing WinForms stuff
<br></br>
(I did manage to make a (literally unusable) mockup GUI with WinForms!)

### Idea [#2](): "C++ and Qt"
I didn't know even a single bit of C++ (nor Qt) at the time, now i now the basics of both, but trust me and my experience), you _can't do it with the "basics" only_
###### 17/08/2024 update: i am actually studying C++ now so.. yeah
<br></br>
So i gave up because after finishing the GUI in Qt Design Studio (and filling up my whole disk because Qt needs like 40 gigs wtf)

### Idea [#3](): "C#, but this time with HTML and CSS!"
[-~-*]()\(# ~#)/[*-~-]() < ["]()the current idea, so let's just say "ongoing"["]()
