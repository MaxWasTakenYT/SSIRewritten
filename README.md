# 💡SSI - Semiautomatic Installer for Spicetify
Why semiautomatic? Because this is actually the finished version of the (never published) "WorstSpicetifyInstaller" project, and since it is just a completed and more "decent" version of WSI.py, it's still (almost) the worst installer for Spicetify🔥
## Working on..🧪
- [x] "Beta" release (deleted.)
- [ ] First release (GUI and TUI, hopefully)
- [ ] Simplified and even more "decent" version (a.k.a. NSS-SpicyInst)
